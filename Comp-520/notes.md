## Lecture 2 - 2019/01/09

* A compiler transforms source files (eg in Java, C) into target code (eg x86)
* A scanner transforms source file characters into more meaningful tokens
  * Keyword - eg `if`
  * Variable identifiers - eg `var0`
  * Syntax/structural elements - eg `{`
  * Note that keywords take precedence over any other rules
  * Whitespace is typically ignored
* Language (Comp 330 Review)
  * &Sigma; - alphabet, set of symbols, typically finite
  * Word - finite sequence of symbols from alphabet
  * &Sigma;* - set of all possible words in &Sigma;
  * Language - subset of &Sigma;*
* Regular languages - languages that can be accepted by a DFA, and for which regular expressions exist
* At its core, a regular expression contains
  * &emptyset; - language with no strings
  * &epsilon; - empty string
  * &alpha; for &alpha; &in; &Sigma;
  * | - alternation 
  * &centerdot; - concatenation 
  * \* - zero or more occurrences

## Lecture 3 - 2019/01/11

* Scanners
  * List of regular expressions; one per token type
  * Internally, transforms regular expressions to DFAs
  *
