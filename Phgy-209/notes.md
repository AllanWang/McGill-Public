  * #Know: total quantity of test substance, concentration of substance after dispersion
  * #Add quantity Q of indicator to vein &rarr; allow time to equilibrate &rarr; remove known volume of blood & centrifuge for plasma &rarr; measure concentration (c) of substance in plasma &rarr; calculate V = Q/c
  * {indicators|Indicator choice}
    * #Non-toxic, diffuse readily, distribute evenly through compartments to be measured, induce no changes in distribution of water, easy to measure
    * Antipyrine, D<sub>2</sub>O, T<sub>2</sub>O – for total body water measurements
    * Radioactively labeled Inulin, sucrose, mannitol – for ECF (does not pass cell membrane)
    * Evans’ blue (T1824) or I<sup>131</sup> – Albumin – for plasma (does not pass capillary wall)

## Ionic Compositions
* ICF – high in K<sup>+</sup> & Mg<sup>++</sup>, low in Na<sup>+</sup> & Cl<sup>-</sup>
* ECF – high in Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>, low in K<sup>+</sup>
* 0.9% NaCl – dilute sea water – matches proper concentration
* Artificial physiological solutions – substitute for plasma/ISF (examples, don’t need to memorize)
  * Physiological saline – 9g NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>O to make 1L

## Units of Concentration
* Amount (mass) of solute: 1g% = 1g solute in 1dL of water
* Number of solute molecules: 1mol = gram molecular weight/1L of H<sub>2</sub>O
* Molality (m) – number of moles of solute dissolved in 1Kg solvent
* Molarity (M) – amount of solute in specific amount of solution
* Number of reactive units: Eq = molarity of ion * valency (ie Na<sup>+</sup> 1Eq/mol, Ca<sup>2+</sup> 2Eq/mol 
* Viability of cells depends on relative constancy of internal environment (milieu intérieur) & requires exchanges with internal & external environment
* Plasma | Capillary wall | ISF | Cell membrane | ICF
* Important transports: lungs, skin, kidneys, GI tract

## Cell Membrane
* Functions – support distinct compositions of ICF & ISF; be selectively permeable
* Highly permeable to H<sub>2</sub>O, lipid-soluble substances, dissolved gases (O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>), small uncharged molecules
* Less permeable to larger molecules, charged particles
* Impermeable to very large molecules
* Properties due to bimolecular phospholipid layers w/ molecules exhibiting lateral mobility
  * Phospholipid, hydrophilic heads, hydrophobic tails
  * Amphipathic – both hydrophilic & hydrophobic parts
* Cholesterol inserted in phospholipid layer adds stability & rigidity
* Proteins
  * Integral – closely associated with phospholipids, mostly cross the membrane (transmembrane)
  * Peripheral – loosely associated, mostly on cytoplasmic side
* Glycocalyx – carbohydrates & glycoproteins on outer side of membrane; gives distinct identity
* Fluid mosaic model
* Functions of plasma membrane proteins
  * Selective transport channel
  * Enzyme
  * Cell surface receptor
  * Cell surface identity marker
  * Cell adhesion
  * Attachment to cytoskeleton

## Transmembrane Transport Pathways
* Via phospholipid bilayer
* Via interaction with protein cluster (channel/carrier)
* Factors – lipid solubility, particle size, electrical charge, available & number of carriers/ion channels
* Passive – energy independent &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Active – energy dependent

## Diffusion
* Resulting from random thermal molecular motion
* Net flux = high &rarr; low concentration
* If permeable, can go through membrane
* J = PA(C<sub>0</sub> – C<sub>i</sub>)
  * J – net flux across membrane
  * P – permeability/diffusion coefficient of membrane
  * A – surface area of membrane
  * C<sub>0</sub> – C<sub>i</sub> – concentration gradient of diffusing molecule
  * Diffusion time increases in proportion to the square of the distance
* Dissolve through lipid components for non-polar molecules and through channels for ions

## Ion Channels
* Consist of single protein or clusters of proteins
* Show selectivity based on diameter & distribution of charges
* Movement affected by electrochemical (electrical & concentration) gradient
* Ligand-gated, voltage-gated, mechanically-gated
* Channels: Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>
* Number of ions flowing through channels generating ionic current depends on
  * Channel conductance
  * How often channel opens
  * How long channel stays open

## Carrier-Mediated Transport
* Specificity – usually transports one type of molecule only
* Saturation – rate of transport reaches maximum when all binding sites on all transporters are occupied; limit – transport maximum (Tm) exists
* Competition – structurally similar substances compete for same binding site on carrier
* Facilitated diffusion – carrier enables solute to penetrate more readily – passive
  * Solute binds to carrier &rarr; changes carrier configuration &rarr; solute is delivered to other side of membrane &rarr; carrier resumes original configuration
  * Ie for glucose, insulin increases number of transporters
* Active transport
  * Requires chemical energy (usually ATP)
  * Susceptible to metabolic inhibitors
  * Can transport against concentration gradient
  * Primary active transport
    * Chemical energy transferred directly from ATP
    * Phosphorylation of transporter changes conformation & affinity of binding site
    * Ie sodium potassium pump – 3Na<sup>+</sup> out, 2K<sup>+</sup> in
* Active – energy dependent – carrier-mediated active transport (primary & secondary), pino/phagocytosis
* Sodium potassium pump
  * Phosphorylation of pump &rarr; change in conformation &rarr; affinity for Na<sup>+</sup> decreases
* Other active transporter proteins – Ca-ATPase, H-ATPase, H/K ATPase
* Secondary Active Transport – relies on electrochemical gradient to bring along another solute
  * Ie glucose transported with Na<sup>+</sup>
  * Cotransport – both solutes move in the same direction
    * Na<sup>+</sup>/glucose, Na<sup>+</sup>/amino acids
  * Countertransport – solutes move in different directions
    * Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>/H+, Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
* Endocytosis – cell membrane invaginates, forming channel, pinching off to form vesicle
  * Pinocytosis (Fluid endocytosis) – ingestion of dissolved materials, liquid contents slowly transferred to the cytosol – not selective
  * Phagocytosis – ingestion of solid particles, particles pinched into phagocytic vacuole (phagosome) – fuses with lysosomes and then degraded
  * Receptor-mediated
    * Clathrin-dependent receptor-mediated endocytosis
    * Potocytosis
* Exocytosis – diffusion of vesicle, releasing content in ECF

## Osmosis – diffusion of water
* Water diffuses freely across most cell membranes
* Aquaporins – groups of proteins facilitating osmosis – forms water permeable channels
* Osmosis – net movement of H2O across semipermeable membrane
* Osmotic pressure – pressure required to oppose the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane
* Osmolarity – total solute concentration of solute – 1 osmol = 1 mol of solute
  * 1 mol glucose = 1 osmol &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1 mol NaCl = 2 osmol
* Osm = osmol/liter
* Ie saline drip – 0.9% saline = 0.15 NaCl = 300mOsm = same mOsm of body<br/>6.7 atm = 5100 mmHg
* Isosmotic – solutions with same number of osmotically active particles
* Hypoosmotic – solutions with lower number of osmotically active particles
* Hyperosmotic – solutions with higher number of osmotically active particles
* Only nonpenetrating particles can exert osmotic pressure
  * Extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> is nonpenetrating as it is pumped out after moving in
* Isotonic – cell retains size
* Hypotonic – cell swells
* Hypertonic – cell shrinks

## Capillaries
* Single layer of flattened endothelial cells & supporting basement membrane
* Diffusion through water filled channels & across cell membranes
* Pinocytosis/exocytosis – endocytosis & vesicle formation on luminal side &rarr; exocytosis & vesicle release on interstitial side
* Bulk flow – flow of molecules due to pressure difference (ultra filtration)
* Filtration – bulk flow across porous membrane (acts like sieve) withholding some particles

## Blood
* Transport – nutritive, respiratory, excretory, hormone transport, temperature regulation
* Acid-base balance – normal pH range 7.30-7.45
* Protective
* Contains both ECF (plasma) & ICF (inside blood cells)
* May be studied in vivo & in vitro
* Accounts for ~7% of body mass = ~5L

  * Separating plasma proteins
    * Differential precipitation by salts
    * Sedimentation in ultracentrifuge
    * Electrophoretic mobility
    * Immunological characteristics
* Electrophoresis – fraction method based on movement of charged particles along voltage gradient
  * Influenced by number, distribution of charges, & MW of each protein
  * Stained and scanned – area under graph peaks shows amount
  * In renal disease – albumin (big left peak) gets significantly smaller
  * In bacterial infection – &gamma; globulins increases due to presence of antibodies
* Majority produced in liver
  * Albumin, fibrinogen, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>, &alpha;<sub>2</sub>, &beta; globulins
* &gamma; globulins produced in lymphoid tissue
