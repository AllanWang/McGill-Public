### 1.1. Definitions

> Experiment - process by which an observation is made

* Ex dice tossing is an experiment since we observe the number appearing on the other side

* Random Experiment
> Random experiment - TODO

> Sample space - S or &Omega; - collection of every possible outcome

> Event - A, B, C - partial collection of sample space

Let P(A) = probability of A &forall;A, A &isin; &Omega;
P(A) has the following axioms:

* $P(A) \ge 0$
* $P(S) = 1$ (unit measure / normed)
* if $i \ne j$ and $A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$, $P(A_i \cup A_j) = P(A_i) + P(A_j)$
