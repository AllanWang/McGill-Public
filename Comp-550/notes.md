## Lecture 1 - 2018/09/04



## Lecture 2 - 2018/09/06

* Morpheme - subpart of a word that cannot be broken down any further
    * Free morphemes can occur on their own
    * Bound morphemes must occur with other morphemes as parts of words
        * Prefix (before), suffix (after), infix (between), circumfix (around)
* Inflectional morphology - expresses grammatical function required by language
* Derivational morphology - derives a new word, possibly of a different part of speech
* Isolating languages - low morpheme-to-word ratio
* Synthetic languages - high morpheme-to-word ratio
* Computation Tasks
    * Morphological recognition - is this a well formed word?
    * Stemming - cut affixes off to find the stem
    * Morphological analysis
        * Lemmatization - remove inflectional morphology & recover lemma
        * Full morphological analysis - recover full structure

* FSA - finite state automata

## Lecture 3 - 2018/09/11

* Word - smallest unit that can appear in isolation
* Convenient assumption is that words are delimited by spaces
* Word frequency
    * Term frequency: TF(w, S) = #w in corpus S
        * eg TF(<i>cat</i>, the cat sat on the mat) = 1
    * Relative frequency: RF(w, S) = TF(w, S) / |S|
        * eg RF(<i>cat</i>, the cat sat on the mat) = &frac16;
* Corpus - collection of text; used for text to count
* Zipf's Law: f &prop; 1/r
    * Frequency of word type is inversely proportional to rank of word type (by frequency)
